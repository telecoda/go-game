It has been kicking around on my hard drive for quite a while.  I thought I may spark a bit of life into the project by actually releasing the source on github.

Please note this code is pre-pre-alpha so could dramatically change at ANY time, whenever I get the whim to work on it again.

## Pre-requisites

Follow the README.md for [go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/blob/master/README.md)
